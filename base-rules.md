# BASE RULES · Mente OS
**Status:** current · **Type:** entry-point · **Updated:** 2026-07-29 · **Owner:** brian
**Ticket:** F2-5 · **Language:** US English
---

## Purpose

The **minimum any AI needs to operate Mente OS.** Written to be tool-agnostic: if you are not Claude
Code, this file plus the pointers below is enough to work correctly.

> **Why it exists:** everything else in v1 assumed Claude Code. `output-styles/` and hooks are
> **acceleration, not foundation** — without them the protocol still works, with less guarantee.

---

## 1 · STARTUP — in this order

```
1 · BASE RULES               ← this file
2 · CONTEXT                  ← what was being worked on
3 · LAST STATE               ← memory/RETOMAR.md
4 · WHICH ARCHITECT?         ← what profile does this task need
5 · TOOLS
6 · OPEN or LOAD the BLOCK
```

**Transversal rule:** *functions and actions always happen inside a block.* Nothing runs outside one.

---

## 2 · THE NON-NEGOTIABLES — by level

> ⚠️ **3 of these 8 are NOT universal** (marked 🏢). They belong in `PROJECT-RULES.md` and are
> pending migration — see `rules/rule-inheritance.md` §6. Listed here meanwhile so nothing is lost.
> **A rule at the wrong level contaminates every block that inherits it.**

| # | Rule | Pointer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Explain → approve → build.** Never build a milestone without explicit approval | `Cuerpo/ESTANDAR_Metodo_Fases_F.md` |
| 2 | **The AI does not invent criterion.** Criterion is Brian's; the AI gives it form | ADR-003 |
| 3 | **Do not state — report the measurement.** An unverified claim is banned | `principles/owner-0-voice.md` |
| 4 | **Secrets are referenced, never pasted** | architecture §12-S.1 |
| 5 | **Scope is declared, never inferred.** No match → **stop and ask** | `rules/rule-isolation.md` |
| 6 | 🏢 **Never read another Mente OS without the gate** | `bridges/Puentes_Mente_OS.md` — **project-level** |
| 7 | 🏢 **Server-first.** Push to GitHub only on explicit order | `feedback_flujo_server_primero` — **project-level** |
| 8 | ⭐ **No `/clear` without registering the session first** | `rules/rule-session-close.md` |

> 🌐 = universal (any project, any block) · 🏢 = specific to this project
> **The inheritance rule:** a lower level may only ADD or TIGHTEN — **never loosen**
> (`rules/rule-inheritance.md`).

## 3 · WHERE THINGS LIVE

| Need | Path |
|---|---|
| Where we left off | `memory/RETOMAR.md` |
| The voice | `principles/owner-0-voice.md` |
| The three owners | `principles/owner-1-docs.md` · `owner-2-dev.md` · `owner-3-validation.md` |
| Expert criterion | `principles/expertise/{database,backend,frontend}.md` |
| Contracts | `rules/contract-block.md` · `contract-document.md` · `contract-adr.md` |
| Rules | `rules/rule-{lanes,fix-not-patch,friction,isolation,session-close}.md` |
| Decisions | `docs/DECISIONS.md` (generated) + `rules/decisions/ADR-*.md` |
| Naming | `rules/NAMING_CONVENTION.md` |
| Architectural truth | `Cerebro/For3s_OS_Grafo_Maestro.md` |
| Active blocks | `blocks/active/<name>/BLOCK.md` |
| What Brian still owes | `docs/PENDING-BRIAN.md` |
| Secrets | `Mente/secrets/` — ⛔ never in git |

---

## 4 · LANGUAGE

| What | Language |
|---|---|
| Conversation with Brian | **Spanish** |
| Anything read as an INSTRUCTION (this file, contracts, rules, `BLOCK.md`) | **US English** |
| Code, identifiers, commits | **US English** |

**Do not suggest switching.** Spanish is Brian's thinking; that is where the nuance lives (ADR-023).

## 5 · THE LAW BEHIND THE WHOLE DESIGN

| Form of a rule | Measured compliance |
|---|---|
| **Code** (gate, fail-closed permissions) | ✅ **100%** |
| **Document** (Método F, pre-`/clear` registration, index) | 🔴 **fails 40-60%** |

> ## The doctrine is a document. The VERIFICATION is a script.
> A script decides nothing — it checks what is checkable: the file exists · has the field · fits its
> limit · the id is unique · it is not stale.

**This is why the validators exist**, and why a rule with no validator should be assumed unenforced.

## 6 · IF YOU ARE NOT CLAUDE CODE

What you lose and what you keep:

| Piece | Without Claude Code |
|---|---|
| `output-styles/` (the voice) | 🔴 not injected → **read `principles/owner-0-voice.md` and apply it** |
| Hooks (inject / block) | 🔴 do not fire → **read §D of the block manually before editing** |
| Auto-injected `CLAUDE.md` | 🔴 → **read this file first** |
| Everything else | ✅ works — it is plain markdown and scripts |

> **The protocol is portable. The hooks are the turbo when they exist** (ADR-011).
